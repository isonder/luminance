### Analysis of Explosive Magma-Water Interaction Experiment Video Recordings

This is a somewhat rough method to quantify what happens when molten rock comes into contact with ambient temperature water, and a video record exists of that process that can be analyzed.
The code came out of the effort to quantify, for a given time, how much molten rock was from the container ejected in which melt and water came into contact.
Since it is difficult to put sensors inside such a container the more remote video based technique was used.
The method is currently meant to be only applied to our experiments, and is of very limited use outside that scope until we developed it further.

To convert the example video to an image sequence the `ffmpeg` video decoder/converter is necessary. The code needs a Python distribution. Therefore, before reading the example, have a look at the [install and setup notes](./setup.md).

Once set up the [example notebook](./Luminance-example.ipynb) provides a walk through this is meant to be used.
